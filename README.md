# Data Analysis of COVID-19 Variants

This project focuses on analyzing the variants of the COVID-19 virus using genomic sequences stored in FASTA format. The primary goal is to compare and analyze the genetic differences between various virus variants to better understand their evolution and characteristics.

## Project Structure

- **Dengue.fasta** and **dengue1.fasta**: FASTA sequence files that may be related to comparative analysis with the Dengue virus.
- **virus_seq_align.fasta** and **virus_seqs.fasta**: Files containing the genomic sequences of the COVID-19 virus for analysis.
- **ev02.R**: R script used to perform sequence analysis and generate results.
- **ev02.html**: HTML report generated from the R script, presenting the analysis results.
- **R 4.2.3.lnk** and **R.Rproj**: Files related to the R development environment.
- **LICENSE**: File specifying the projectâ€™s license.
  
## Usage

To reproduce the analysis, run the included R scripts, ensuring that the genomic sequences are properly aligned and prepared for analysis.
